## 1. What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Think of it as a digital filing cabinet where information is stored in a structured way, making it easy to retrieve, update, and manage. Databases are used everywhere—from websites and mobile apps to business applications and scientific research.

### Key Points:
- **Purpose**: Databases store data in a way that allows efficient querying and management.
- **Structure**: Data is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns (similar to a spreadsheet).
- **Examples**: Customer records, product inventories, or student grades are all stored in databases.
- **Benefits**: Databases ensure data consistency, security, and scalability.
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Software like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle that manages databases.

### Examples:
1. **Customer Database**: A table storing customer names, emails, and phone numbers for an e-commerce website.
   ```sql
   -- Example of a customer table structure
   CREATE TABLE customers (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       email VARCHAR(100),
       phone VARCHAR(20)
   );
   ```
2. **Inventory Database**: A table tracking products in a store.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       product_name VARCHAR(100),
       price DECIMAL(10, 2),
       stock_quantity INTEGER
   );
   ```
3. **Student Database**: A table for managing student information in a school.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
       student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       first_name VARCHAR(50),
       last_name VARCHAR(50),
       grade INTEGER
   );
   ```
4. **Order Database**: A table to track customer orders.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       customer_id INTEGER,
       order_date DATE,
       total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );
   ```
5. **Employee Database**: A table for employee records in a company.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       department VARCHAR(50),
       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );
   ```

## 2. Types of Databases

Databases come in different types, each suited for specific use cases. The two main categories are **relational** and **non-relational** databases.

### Key Points:
- **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data, with relationships defined between them. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying.
  - Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
- **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**: Store data in formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They are flexible for unstructured data.
  - Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
- **Other Types**: Hierarchical databases (tree-like structures), network databases, and object-oriented databases.
- **Choosing a Database**: Relational databases are great for structured data with clear relationships, while NoSQL databases are better for unstructured or rapidly changing data.

### Examples:
1. **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**: A table for a library’s books.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE books (
       book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(200),
       author VARCHAR(100),
       publication_year INTEGER
   );
   ```
2. **NoSQL Document Database (MongoDB-like structure)**: A JSON-like document for a blog post.
   ```json
   {
       "post_id": 1,
       "title": "Introduction to SQL",
       "author": "Jane Doe",
       "content": "This is a blog post about SQL...",
       "tags": ["SQL", "databases", "PostgreSQL"]
   }
   ```
3. **Key-Value Database (Redis-like structure)**: Storing user session data.
   ```plaintext
   SET user:12345 "name=John Doe, email=john@example.com"
   ```
4. **Graph Database (Neo4j-like structure)**: Representing social network relationships.
   ```cypher
   CREATE (john:Person {name: 'John Doe'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(jane:Person {name: 'Jane Smith'})
   ```
5. **Hierarchical Database**: A tree-like structure for an organization’s departments.
   ```plaintext
   Company
   ├── HR
   │   ├── Recruitment
   │   └── Payroll
   └── Engineering
       ├── Frontend
       └── Backend
   ```

## 3. Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data (often referred to as CRUD operations).

### Key Points:
- **Purpose**: SQL is used to query and manage data in relational databases.
- **Commands**:
  - **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Define database structures (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manipulate data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
  - **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Manage permissions (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).
- **Syntax**: SQL is case-insensitive, but it’s common to write keywords in uppercase for clarity.
- **Portability**: SQL is standardized, but some features vary across DBMS like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

### Examples:
1. **Selecting Data**: Retrieve all columns from a table.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers;
   ```
2. **Inserting Data**: Add a new customer to the `customers` table.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone) 
   VALUES ('Alice Smith', 'alice@example.com', '555-1234');
   ```
3. **Updating Data**: Update a customer’s email.
   ```sql
   UPDATE customers 
   SET email = 'alice.new@example.com' 
   WHERE name = 'Alice Smith';
   ```
4. **Deleting Data**: Remove a customer from the table.
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM customers 
   WHERE name = 'Alice Smith';
   ```
5. **Creating a Table**: Define a new table for storing reviews.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE reviews (
       review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       book_id INTEGER,
       rating INTEGER,
       comment TEXT
   );
   ```

## 4. Setting up PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system. To start using it, you need to install it and set up a connection.

### Key Points:
- **Installation**: Download PostgreSQL from the official website or use a package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu, `brew` for macOS).
- **Accessing PostgreSQL**: Use the `psql` command-line tool or a GUI like pgAdmin.
- **Default User**: PostgreSQL creates a default user named `postgres`.
- **Configuration**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and you have the correct credentials to connect.
- **Tools**: `psql` for command-line access, pgAdmin for a graphical interface.

### Examples:
1. **Checking PostgreSQL Version**: Verify your installation.
   ```sql
   SELECT version();
   ```
2. **Connecting to PostgreSQL**: Use `psql` to connect as the default user.
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```
3. **Listing Databases**: Check available databases after connecting.
   ```sql
   \l
   ```
4. **Creating a Superuser**: Set up a new admin user.
   ```sql
   CREATE USER admin_user WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'admin123';
   ```
5. **Checking Connection Status**: Verify the current database and user.
   ```sql
   SELECT current_database(), current_user;
   ```

## 5. Basic Database Operations

Once PostgreSQL is set up, you can perform basic operations like creating, connecting to, and managing databases and users.

### Key Points:
- **Creating Databases**: Use `CREATE DATABASE` to set up a new database.
- **Connecting to Databases**: Use `\c` in `psql` to switch databases.
- **Dropping Databases**: Use `DROP DATABASE` to delete a database (use with caution!).
- **User Management**: Create users and assign privileges using `CREATE USER` and `GRANT`.
- **Information Commands**: Use `psql` meta-commands (e.g., `\l`, `\dt`, `\du`) to inspect the database.

### Examples:
1. **Creating a Database**: Set up a new database for a bookstore.
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
   ```
2. **Connecting to a Database**: Switch to the `bookstore` database.
   ```sql
   \c bookstore
   ```
3. **Dropping a Database**: Remove an unused database.
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS old_database;
   ```
4. **Creating a User with Privileges**: Set up a user with access to the `bookstore` database.
   ```sql
   CREATE USER bookstore_user WITH PASSWORD 'book123';
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE bookstore TO bookstore_user;
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO bookstore_user;
   ```
5. **Listing Database Information**: Check the size of the current database.
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));
   ```
