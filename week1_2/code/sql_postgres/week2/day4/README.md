This document provides an overview of database transactions and concurrency control, including definitions, examples, and visualizations using Mermaid.js diagrams to help students understand these concepts more effectively.

## Topics Covered

1. **Understanding Database Transactions**  
   A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work, ensuring data integrity. Transactions either complete fully or not at all.

2. **ACID Properties**  
   - **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations in a transaction are completed; if any fail, the entire transaction is rolled back.  
   - **Consistency**: Guarantees the database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.  
   - **Isolation**: Ensures transactions are executed independently of one another.  
   - **Durability**: Guarantees that committed transactions are permanently saved, even in case of a system failure.

3. **Transaction Isolation Levels**  
   Isolation levels define how transactions interact and control visibility of changes. Supported levels in PostgreSQL:  
   - READ UNCOMMITTED (behaves like READ COMMITTED in PostgreSQL)  
   - READ COMMITTED (default)  
   - REPEATABLE READ  
   - SERIALIZABLE  

4. **Concurrency Issues**  
   - **Dirty Reads**: Reading uncommitted changes from another transaction.  
   - **Non-repeatable Reads**: Data changes between reads within the same transaction.  
   - **Phantom Reads**: New rows appear in a queryâ€™s result set during a transaction.

5. **Locking Mechanisms**  
   Locks control access to database resources to prevent conflicts during concurrent transactions. Examples include row-level locks (`FOR UPDATE`) and table-level locks.

6. **Deadlocks and How to Avoid Them**  
   A deadlock occurs when two transactions wait indefinitely for each other to release resources. Prevention includes consistent lock ordering and timeouts.

7. **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control**  
   - **Optimistic**: Assumes conflicts are rare, checks for conflicts at commit time (e.g., using version numbers).  
   - **Pessimistic**: Locks resources during the transaction to prevent conflicts.

## Mermaid.js Diagrams

### Transaction Flow
This diagram illustrates the basic flow of a database transaction.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Begin Transaction] --> B[Execute Operations]
    B --> C{Check Constraints}
    C -->|Valid| D[Commit Transaction]
    C -->|Invalid| E[Rollback Transaction]
    D --> F[Changes Saved]
    E --> G[Changes Discarded]
```

### Concurrency Issues
This diagram shows how different transactions can lead to concurrency issues like dirty reads.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Transaction 1
    participant T2 as Transaction 2
    participant DB as Database
    
    T1->>DB: BEGIN
    T1->>DB: UPDATE accounts SET balance = 900 WHERE account_id = 1
    T2->>DB: BEGIN
    T2->>DB: SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1
    Note right of T2: Reads uncommitted data (900) - Dirty Read
    T1->>DB: ROLLBACK
    T2->>DB: COMMIT
```

### Deadlock Scenario
This diagram demonstrates a deadlock caused by inconsistent lock ordering.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Transaction 1
    participant T2 as Transaction 2
    participant DB as Database
    
    T1->>DB: BEGIN
    T1->>DB: UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 100 WHERE order_id = 1
    T2->>DB: BEGIN
    T2->>DB: UPDATE order_items SET quantity = 5 WHERE item_id = 3
    T1->>DB: UPDATE order_items SET quantity = 3 WHERE item_id = 1
    Note right of T1: Waits for T2 to release order_items
    T2->>DB: UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 125 WHERE order_id = 2
    Note right of T2: Waits for T1 to release orders
    Note over T1,T2: Deadlock Detected!
```

## Examples and Exercises

### Example 1: Basic Transaction Structure

```sql
-- Create a sample banking database
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    balance NUMERIC(12, 2) CHECK (balance >= 0)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO accounts (customer_name, balance)
VALUES 
    ('Alice', 1000.00),
    ('Bob', 500.00),
    ('Charlie', 1500.00),
    ('Diana', 2000.00);

-- Basic transaction to transfer money between accounts
BEGIN;
    -- Deduct from sender
    UPDATE accounts 
    SET balance = balance - 100.00 
    WHERE account_id = 1;
    
    -- Add to recipient
    UPDATE accounts 
    SET balance = balance + 100.00 
    WHERE account_id = 2;
    
    -- Check if sender's balance is still valid
    -- If the CHECK constraint fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back
COMMIT;

-- Check the results
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id IN (1, 2);

-- Transaction with explicit savepoints
BEGIN;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50.00 WHERE account_id = 3;
    
    SAVEPOINT before_second_update;
    
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50.00 WHERE account_id = 4;
    
    -- Decide to revert just the second update
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_second_update;
    
    -- Do something else instead
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50.00 WHERE account_id = 1;
COMMIT;

-- Check the results
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id IN (1, 3, 4);
```

### Example 2: Transaction Isolation Levels

```sql
-- Understand the available isolation levels
-- PostgreSQL supports four isolation levels:
-- READ UNCOMMITTED (behaves like READ COMMITTED in PostgreSQL)
-- READ COMMITTED (default)
-- REPEATABLE READ
-- SERIALIZABLE

-- Show the current isolation level
SHOW transaction_isolation;

-- Example with READ COMMITTED (default)
-- Terminal 1
BEGIN;
    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
    -- See: 1000.00
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2 runs:
    -- BEGIN;
    -- UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_id = 1;
    -- COMMIT;
    
    -- Now when Terminal 1 runs the same query again:
    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
    -- Will see: 1200.00 (because it reads the committed change)
COMMIT;

-- Example with REPEATABLE READ
-- Terminal 1
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
    -- See: 1200.00
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2 runs:
    -- BEGIN;
    -- UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
    -- COMMIT;
    
    -- Now when Terminal 1 runs the same query again:
    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
    -- Will still see: 1200.00 (not 1300.00) because it uses the same snapshot
COMMIT;

-- Example with SERIALIZABLE
-- Terminal 1
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    SELECT SUM(balance) FROM accounts;
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2 runs:
    -- BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    -- INSERT INTO accounts (customer_name, balance) VALUES ('Eve', 300.00);
    -- COMMIT;
    
    -- When Terminal 1 tries to do something based on its view:
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance * 1.1;
    -- This might fail with: ERROR: could not serialize access due to concurrent update
COMMIT;
```

### Example 3: Handling Concurrency Issues

```sql
-- Create a simple inventory table
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INTEGER CHECK (quantity >= 0)
);

INSERT INTO inventory (product_name, quantity)
VALUES 
    ('Laptop', 10),
    ('Smartphone', 20),
    ('Headphones', 30);

-- Simulate a concurrency issue with READ COMMITTED
-- Terminal 1: Customer 1 checks product availability
BEGIN;
    SELECT quantity FROM inventory WHERE product_id = 1;
    -- See: 10 laptops available
    
    -- Terminal 1 pauses to think...
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2: Customer 2 buys 3 laptops
    -- BEGIN;
    -- UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 3 WHERE product_id = 1;
    -- COMMIT;
    
    -- Terminal 1 resumes and tries to buy 8 laptops
    UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 8 WHERE product_id = 1;
    -- This succeeds but leaves -1 laptops! (if no CHECK constraint)
COMMIT;

-- Fix with explicit locking
-- Terminal 1: Customer 1 checks product availability
BEGIN;
    -- Lock the row with FOR UPDATE to prevent other transactions from modifying it
    SELECT quantity FROM inventory WHERE product_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
    -- See: 7 laptops available
    
    -- Terminal 1 pauses to think...
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2: Customer 2 tries to buy 3 laptops
    -- BEGIN;
    -- The following will wait until Terminal 1's transaction completes:
    -- SELECT quantity FROM inventory WHERE product_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
    
    -- Terminal 1 resumes and buys 7 laptops
    UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 7 WHERE product_id = 1;
COMMIT;

-- After Terminal 1 commits, Terminal 2 will see the updated quantity
-- and can make its decision based on accurate data
```

### Example 4: Deadlock Prevention and Handling

```sql
-- Create tables for deadlock demonstration
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    total_amount NUMERIC(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    unit_price NUMERIC(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total_amount)
VALUES 
    (101, 0),
    (102, 0);

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price)
VALUES 
    (1, 1, 2, 25.00),
    (1, 2, 1, 50.00),
    (2, 1, 3, 25.00),
    (2, 3, 2, 15.00);

-- Situation that could lead to a deadlock:
-- Terminal 1
BEGIN;
    UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 100.00 WHERE order_id = 1;
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2 runs:
    -- BEGIN;
    -- UPDATE order_items SET quantity = 5 WHERE item_id = 3;
    
    -- Terminal 1 now tries to update order_items:
    UPDATE order_items SET quantity = 3 WHERE item_id = 1;
    
    -- While Terminal 2 tries to update orders:
    -- UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 125.00 WHERE order_id = 2;
    
    -- Deadlock! One transaction will be chosen as the victim and rolled back
COMMIT;

-- Preventing deadlocks by consistent lock ordering
-- Always update tables in the same order (e.g., always update orders before order_items)

-- Terminal 1
BEGIN;
    -- First, lock any rows in orders that will be modified
    UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 100.00 WHERE order_id = 1;
    
    -- Then lock rows in order_items
    UPDATE order_items SET quantity = 3 WHERE item_id = 1;
COMMIT;

-- Terminal 2 (follows the same pattern)
BEGIN;
    -- First, lock any rows in orders that will be modified
    UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 125.00 WHERE order_id = 2;
    
    -- Then lock rows in order_items
    UPDATE order_items SET quantity = 5 WHERE item_id = 3;
COMMIT;
```

### Example 5: Advisory Locks

```sql
-- PostgreSQL advisory locks are application-defined locks that can be used
-- to coordinate access to resources not directly tied to a database row

-- Create a function that simulates a long-running process
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_data(process_id INTEGER)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Try to acquire an advisory lock
    IF pg_try_advisory_lock(process_id) THEN
        -- Got the lock, do the work
        RAISE NOTICE 'Processing data for process %', process_id;
        
        -- Simulate work by sleeping
        PERFORM pg_sleep(10);
        
        -- Release the lock when done
        PERFORM pg_advisory_unlock(process_id);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Process % completed', process_id;
    ELSE
        -- Could not get the lock, process already running
        RAISE NOTICE 'Process % is already running', process_id;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Call the function (open multiple sessions to test)
SELECT process_data(1);
```

### Example 6: Optimistic Concurrency Control

```sql
-- Create a table with a version column for optimistic concurrency control
CREATE TABLE documents (
    document_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    content TEXT,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

INSERT INTO documents (title, content)
VALUES ('Meeting Notes', 'Initial meeting notes content.');

-- Optimistic concurrency approach:
-- Terminal 1: User 1 reads the document
BEGIN;
    SELECT document_id, title, content, version 
    FROM documents 
    WHERE document_id = 1;
    -- Gets version 1
    
    -- Meanwhile, Terminal 2: User 2 updates the document
    -- BEGIN;
    -- UPDATE documents 
    -- SET content = 'Updated by User 2.', version = version + 1
    -- WHERE document_id = 1 AND version = 1;
    -- COMMIT;
    -- Document now has version 2
    
    -- Terminal 1: User 1 tries to update with outdated version
    UPDATE documents 
    SET content = 'Updated by User 1.', version = version + 1
    WHERE document_id = 1 AND version = 1;
    
    -- This will update 0 rows because version is now 2
    GET DIAGNOSTICS rowcount = ROW_COUNT;
    IF rowcount = 0 THEN
        ROLLBACK;
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Document was modified by another user';
    ELSE
        COMMIT;
    END IF;
END;
```
