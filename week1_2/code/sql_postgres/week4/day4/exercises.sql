-- Day 4: Performance Tuning and Optimization - Exercises

-- Exercise 1: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to compare the performance of a query with and without an index on a large table.

-- Exercise 2: Create a GIN index on a tags column in a products table and show how it improves search performance.

-- Exercise 3: Run VACUUM and ANALYZE on a table and explain the effects.

-- Exercise 4: Change a configuration parameter (e.g., work_mem) and observe its effect on query performance (describe the steps).

-- Exercise 5: Use pg_stat_activity to find all currently running queries.

-- Exercise 6: Enable logging of slow queries and find the slowest query in the logs.

-- Exercise 7: Partition a large table and compare query performance before and after partitioning.
